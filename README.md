# Code Cafe at Coffee Revolution

Do you want to learn a little more about programming but never find the time?
Why not join us at the Code Cafe at Coffee Revolution? A group of research software engineers will be on hand to help you work through some programming exercises.

Drink coffee, learn some code, chat to other researchers, data scientists and programmers.
